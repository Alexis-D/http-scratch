# Scratch: an HTTP Server/Web Framework written from scratch

This is just a toy HTTP server/micro web framework. You should probably not
use as it was written on a rainy/lazy day and because it has not other
purposes than to toying with writing a HTTP server in plain Python.

If you want to write a HTTP server from scratch you might want to look at
[HTTP made really easy](http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/) or at the
[HTTP/1.1 RFC 2616](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html).

If you're looking for a nice Python micro web framework then you should check
[Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/) out.
